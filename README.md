# Saturday Night Something To Do

Welcome to the "Saturday Night Something To Do" repository. This project is a web application that allows users to input their information via a web form. The data is then submitted to the backend and stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

The application provides the following features:

- **Create User**: Users can input their information via a web form and submit it. The data is then stored in the database.
- **Read User**: Users can view the information of a specific user.
- **Update User**: Users can update the information of a specific user.
- **Delete User**: Users can delete a specific user.
- **List All Users**: Users can view a list of all users.

These features are provided through five endpoints that are accessible via the web form.

## Real-Time Updates

The web page is updated in real-time using HTMX and templ templates. This means that when a user submits the form, the page is updated without needing to be refreshed.

## Work In Progress

Please note that this project is a work in progress. While the basic functionality is in place, there may be bugs and the design may change.
